Trained a Random Forest classification model to predict student depression using lifestyle, academic, and demographic data from 502 college students. The dataset was preprocessed with a combination of one-hot and ordinal encoding, followed by a 70/30 train-test split. To address class imbalance, the ROSE method was applied during training. The final model used 500 trees and considered three variables at each split. It demonstrated strong performance, achieving 88.74% accuracy, 85.63% sensitivity, 92.00% specificity, and an AUC of 0.9696. Top predictors including academic pressure, suicidal thoughts, financial stress, age, and study satisfaction. These findings underscore the modelâ€™s effectiveness in distinguishing between depressed and non-depressed students based on self-reported indicators.
